### Text Colors
The text color for each button class is determined by either $button-color or $button-color-alt, whichever settings variable has more contrast.

> The default settings meet WCAG 2.0 level AA contrast requirements. Be sure to [check the contrast](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) when changing color variables. To give all buttons the same color text, set `$button-color` and `$button-color-alt` to the same value â€” but know that doing so may decrease accessibility.
